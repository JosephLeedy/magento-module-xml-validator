## I Have a Question

If you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the [documentation].

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [issues] that might
help you. If you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you
can ask your question in that issue. It is also advisable to search the Internet
for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we
recommend the following:

- Open a [new issue]
- Provide as much context as you can about the problem that you're running into.
(What you were doing when it occurred, what you expected to happen, steps to
reproduce the issue, etc.)
- Provide your Magento Open Source or Adobe Commerce and PHP versions
- Provide a list of any additional third-party extensions installed that might
cause a conflict

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you down for more
information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information
and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following
steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side (e.g.
using incompatible environment components/versions). Make sure that you have
read the [documentation]. If you are looking for support, please see the
"[I Have a Question]" section.
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the
same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing
for your bug or error in the [bug tracker]
- Please also make sure to search the Internet (including Stack Overflow) to see
if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue
- Collect information about the bug:
  - Stack trace (if available)
  - OS and Version (e.g. Windows 11, Ubuntu Linux 04.22, macOS Ventura 13.0.1)
  - Versions of Magento Open Source or Adobe Commerce and PHP
  - Your input and the output of the tool
  - Whether you can reliably reproduce the issue and if can you also reproduce
  it with older versions of the tool

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including
sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead,
sensitive bugs must be reported via a [GitHub Security Advisory].

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the
project:

- Open a [new issue]. (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug
or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the
*reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their
own. For good bug reports, you should isolate the problem and create a reduced
test case.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section

Once it's filed:

- The development team will label the issue accordingly
- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If
there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the
team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as `needs-reproduction`.
Bugs with the `needs-reproduction` tag will not be addressed until they are
reproduced.
- If our team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked `needs-fix`, as
well as possibly other tags (such as `critical`) and the issue will be assigned
to be implemented by a developer.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for
Joseph Leedy XML Validator, **including completely new features and minor
improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help
our developers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related
suggestions.

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version
- Read the [documentation] carefully and find out if the functionality is
already covered
- Search the existing [issues] to see if the enhancement has already been
suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a
new one.
- Determine whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project.
It is up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of
the merits of this feature. Please keep in mind that we want features that will
be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're
only targeting a minority of users, please consider writing an add-on extension.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues].

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the
suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many
details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to
see instead** and why. At this point, you can also tell us which alternatives do
not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you
demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to.
You can use [LICEcap] to record GIFs on macOS and Windows and [Silentcast] on
Linux. Alternatively, [Loom] is a paid screen recording app available for macOS,
Windows and other platforms.
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most users. You may also
want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve
as inspiration.
