# XML Validator by Joseph Leedy

XML Validator by Joseph Leedy is a development tool for Magento Open Source and
Adobe Commerce that adds a console command for validating XML files against
their configured schema.

## Features & Benefits

thereby reducing deployment and runtime errors

  2.4.5 or greater recommended_)
- PHP version 7.4.32 or greater, or PHP 8.1.12 or greater (_recommended_)

## Installation

The XML Validator extension is available for installation via Composer by
entering the following commands into your terminal or command prompt:

### Post-Installation
